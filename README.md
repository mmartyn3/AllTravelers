Repo for iOS food allergy app

The app translates the 9 major allergens: Milk, Eggs, Fish, Crustacean shellfish, Tree nuts, Peanuts, Wheat, Soybeans, Sesame [(according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA))](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/food-allergies-what-you-need-know) into 100 languages.

The app was inspired by my own expierence traveling in Asia for 3 months with a coconut allergy.
